Mr. Bean is a well-meaning yet clumsy and destructive security guard working at the "Royal National Gallery" in London. When the gallery's board of directors, who despise Bean for sleeping on the job, fail to fire him due to the chairman threatening repercussions, the board immediately decides on a different course of action and has him represent them during the transfer of the portrait Whistler's Mother to the Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles, following its purchase by philanthropist General Newton for $50 million. The curator of the Grierson, David Langley, who is impressed with the false profile of "Dr. Bean", agrees to accommodate him at his house for two months, much to the chagrin of his wife Alison, his son Kevin and daughter Jennifer. After Bean encounters mishaps with the airport police and accidentally breaks a family heirloom, Alison leaves for her mother's house along with Kevin and Jennifer. 
David begins to question Bean's intelligence after he suggests they head to an amusement park where he rigs the control panel of a simulator ride to make it more exciting for him, resulting in him getting him arrested a second time, and he later messes up a dinner with the gallery's owner George Grierson. When David questions Bean, he finds out that Bean is not a doctor after all, after having knew absolutely nothing about art, and things get worse when Bean accidentally defaces the painting shortly after it arrives. Fearing that he will lose his job and possibly face criminal charges for the damage, David becomes despondent and gets drunk, even though his family returns out of pity.
To save David's career and not get arrested again, Bean sneaks back into the gallery, distracts the guard by lacing his cup of coffee with laxatives and replaces the defaced painting with a poster. The plan works on the next day, fooling everyone including Newton. Bean nearly panics when he has to make a speech, but gives an improvised, sentimental and deep monologue about the painting that wins the crowd's praise and approval.
Bean is then approached by Lieutenant Brutus (with whom he crossed paths on two earlier incidents), making David worried that he knows the truth about the priceless painting's mishap, only to learn from him that Jennifer was rushed to a hospital after being involved in a motorcycle accident along with her boyfriend. Rushing to the hospital, David goes to be with his wife, leaving Bean to wander around the hospital's reception area and be mistaken for a doctor after picking up a stethoscope that had been accidentally dropped onto the floor. Forced into a surgery room and dressed in surgical scrubs, Bean comes across Brutus on the operating table (who have been shot while dealing with a mugging), whereupon he manages to remove the bullet from his body via an unorthodox procedure which saves his life. David then begs Bean for his help in reviving Jennifer from a coma, to which he succeeds after an accident with a defibrillator sends him flying and landing on top of her. Grateful for having their daughter back, David and Alison are surprised when Bean reveals his true identity. At Bean's suggestion, they repay him by allowing him to stay with them for another week.
After spending some quality time with David's family, Bean heads back to the airport and thanks David for the time he spent with them before returning home to London. At his flat, Bean admires his bedroom which is now decorated with photos of himself and the Langleys as well as the original Whistler's Mother painting he ruined and smuggled back with him, before going to bed.
